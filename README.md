# PLEASE NOTE
Due to lack of interest I have taken down the deskOS website and the hosting of the large ISO image build artifacts for the demo's.
If you are interested in this project, do not hesitate to contact me via https://michaelsmith.be.

## Run a deskOS demo in a virtual machine

If you are running NixOS or you have the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) installed, you can easily run a deskOS demo from this flake:

```sh
nix run github:nixup-io/desk-os
```
